# 4-Bit-Comparator-Using-2-Bit-Comparator-Verilog-Code
A Comparator is a combinational circuit that gives output in terms of A>B, A&lt;B, and A=B. This is entirely expected from the name. A digital comparatorâ€™s purpose is to compare numbers and represent their relationship with each other.

In this repository, I've used gate level modeling and function calling method to create a 4 bit comparator using 2 bit comparator. Test Betch of the 4 bit comparator is also included in the word file attaich to it. Beside that all the xilinxs files are present in the folder named "assign 1".
